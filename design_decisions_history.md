# Design decisions history

This retrospective records significant decisions from Git history and available
session requirements. Implementation details belong in the individual projects.

## Separate projects and reproducible references

Commits `69b1fb0`, `ce277b1`, `708f380`, `c1d89db`, `a740487` and `2321b60`
converted projects to submodules, allowing independent histories while keeping
explicit versions in the umbrella repository. `9831b6b` documented this layout.
`7a74751` retained HTTPS URLs for anonymous cloning and GitHub linking; agent-side
Git operations use SSH, while AAP source synchronization uses HTTPS.

## Encrypted runtime configuration

`0655913` made encrypted configuration available to AAP at runtime without
committing plaintext secrets. `a9c30e9` added an encrypted network inventory and
a central inventory/CMDB follow-up, so environment-specific addressing remains
protected while a more durable source of truth is considered.

## Modular disconnected Windows demo

`e9b63cd` introduced the Windows project. `4d0c32d` tracked separate Windows
basics, WSUS and Chocolatey setup stages for independent execution and recovery.
`c8bf8cf` added parallel service setup after preparation and explicit WSUS
synchronization/export/import. `9beea27` tracked the equivalent application
content pipeline and baseline-to-current upgrades.

## Guarded lifecycle and focused recovery

`0112532` tracked Windows-only clone destruction guards. `9344954` added
independent teardown verification and a reliable scheduled network launcher.
`06e3d83` tracked bounded WinRM reconnection during network changes. These
decisions support repeated demo deployment while protecting unrelated VMs.

## Approved repository onboarding

`13dc9e8` tracked version-scoped, idempotent Nexus EULA acceptance after explicit
approval. The Windows project's decision history records the implementation
commits and subsequent validation fixes in greater detail.

The updated Windows reference includes `95cbd03` for Windows package-array
validation and `cb629a0` for the verified application pipeline and retrospective
history. Targeted recovery retained the successful VM and WSUS stages while
verifying both internal release feeds and endnode upgrades.

`06474a4` records the subsequent successful fresh-environment workflow 1252,
which verified all 17 stages together after guarded Windows-only teardown and
preservation checks. No design change was needed for that complete rerun.
